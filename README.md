# Pi Vault: The Scam
## How Burgduino Electronics Took My Money and Ghosted Me

I'm **Adrian**. I'm writing this because I'm done being polite.

Three years ago, I paid for a **Pi Vault** (a UPS for Raspberry Pi). I never received it.
I repeatedly asked for a refund. I never got that, either.

The conclusion is simple: **Burgduino Electronics** stole my money.

## The Trap

Three years ago, I attempted to purchase a Pi Vault from Burgduino Electronics. The seller directly instructed me:

> "Pay me directly on PayPal. It's faster."

I made the critical error of trusting him. By paying off-platform (despite his presence on Tindie), I voluntarily voided all buyer protection. This was by design.

## Three Years of Lies

What followed wasn't a simple delay; it was a calculated campaign of deception that lasted **three years**.

* **The Shipping Lie:** "I'll ship it next week." A promise repeated for months without any action.
* **The Refund Lie:** "I will refund you." A hollow assurance he never intended to honor.

Every inquiry was met with a new excuse: "Things are crazy," "I don't have work," "I forgot." Eventually, the communication stopped entirely. He kept the money and vanished.

## The Evidence and Report

In **October 2024**, I decided to act. I contacted the marketplace support where he operates and reported his store.

**From my report to Support:**

> "I purchased a Pi Vault... via PayPal at his suggestion. He never shipped the product... promised a refund multiple times... I never received one. I'm asking you to review his activity so future customers don't end up in the same situation."

They requested evidence. I provided **everything**: complete chat logs, every broken promise, and screenshots of him explicitly stating, "Refund coming tonight."

## A Final Warning

Let my experience be your lesson.

1. **If a seller asks for a direct PayPal payment,** refuse.
2. **If they insist on "Friends and Family,"** it is a scam. Walk away.
3. **If they delay shipping beyond a reasonable timeframe,** file a dispute immediately.

**Burgduino Electronics** is still active. Do not let him do to you what he did to me.
