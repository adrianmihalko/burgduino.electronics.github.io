<h2 id="how-burgduino-electronics-took-my-money-and-ghosted-me">How Burgduino Electronics Took My Money and Ghosted Me</h2>
<p>I&#39;m <strong>Adrian</strong>. I&#39;m writing this because I&#39;m done being polite.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I paid for a <strong>Pi Vault</strong> (a UPS for Raspberry Pi). I never received it.
I repeatedly asked for a refund. I never got that, either.</p>
<p>The conclusion is simple: <strong>Burgduino Electronics</strong> stole my money.</p>

<h2 id="the-trap">The Trap</h2>
<p>Three years ago, I attempted to purchase a Pi Vault from Burgduino Electronics. The seller directly instructed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pay me directly on PayPal. It&#39;s faster.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made the critical error of trusting him. By paying off-platform (despite his presence on Tindie), I voluntarily voided all buyer protection. This was by design.</p>
<h2 id="three-years-of-lies">Three Years of Lies</h2>
<p>What followed wasn&#39;t a simple delay; it was a calculated campaign of deception that lasted <strong>three years</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Shipping Lie:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll ship it next week.&quot; A promise repeated for months without any action.</li>
<li><strong>The Refund Lie:</strong> &quot;I will refund you.&quot; A hollow assurance he never intended to honor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every inquiry was met with a new excuse: &quot;Things are crazy,&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t have work,&quot; &quot;I forgot.&quot; Eventually, the communication stopped entirely. He kept the money and vanished.</p>
<h2 id="the-evidence-and-report">The Evidence and Report</h2>
<p>In <strong>October 2024</strong>, I decided to act. I contacted the marketplace support where he operates and reported his store.</p>
<p><strong>From my report to Support:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I purchased a Pi Vault... via PayPal at his suggestion. He never shipped the product... promised a refund multiple times... I never received one. I&#39;m asking you to review his activity so future customers don&#39;t end up in the same situation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They requested evidence. I provided <strong>everything</strong>: complete chat logs, every broken promise, and screenshots of him explicitly stating, &quot;Refund coming tonight.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="a-final-warning">A Final Warning</h2>
<p>Let my experience be your lesson.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If Burgduino asks for a direct PayPal payment,</strong> refuse.</li>
<li><strong>If he insist on &quot;Friends and Family,&quot;</strong> it is a scam. Walk away.</li>
<li><strong>If he delay shipping beyond a reasonable timeframe,</strong> file a dispute immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Burgduino Electronics</strong> is still active. Do not let him do to you what he did to me.</p>
