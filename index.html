      <p>I'm <strong>Adrian</strong>. I'm writing this because I'm done being polite.</p>
      <p>Three years ago, I paid for a <strong>Pi Vault</strong> (a UPS for Raspberry Pi). I never received it. I repeatedly asked for a refund. I never got that, either.</p>
      <p>The conclusion is simple: <strong>Burgduino Electronics</strong> stole my money.</p>

        <h2 id="the-trap">The Trap</h2>
        <p>Three years ago, I attempted to purchase a Pi Vault from Burgduino Electronics. The seller directly instructed me:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Pay me directly on PayPal. It's faster."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I made the critical error of trusting him. By paying off-platform (despite his presence on Tindie), I voluntarily voided all buyer protection. This was by design.</p>

        <h2 id="three-years-of-lies">Three Years of Lies</h2>
        <p>What followed wasn't a simple delay; it was a calculated campaign of deception that lasted <strong>three years</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Shipping Lie:</strong> "I'll ship it next week." A promise repeated for months without any action.</li>
          <li><strong>The Refund Lie:</strong> "I will refund you." A hollow assurance he never intended to honor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every inquiry was met with a new excuse: "Things are crazy," "I don't have work," "I forgot." Eventually, the communication stopped entirely. He kept the money and vanished.</p>

        <h2 id="the-evidence-and-report">The Evidence and Report</h2>
        <p>In <strong>October 2024</strong>, I decided to act. I contacted the marketplace support where he operates and reported his store.</p>
        <p><strong>From my report to Support:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I purchased a Pi Vault... via PayPal at his suggestion. He never shipped the product... promised a refund multiple times... I never received one. I'm asking you to review his activity so future customers don't end up in the same situation."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>They requested evidence. I provided <strong>everything</strong>: complete chat logs, every broken promise, and screenshots of him explicitly stating, "Refund coming tonight."</p>

        <h2 id="a-final-warning">A Final Warning</h2>
        <p>Let my experience be your lesson.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>If Burgduino asks for a direct PayPal payment,</strong> refuse.</li>
          <li><strong>If he insists on "Friends and Family,"</strong> it is a scam. Walk away.</li>
          <li><strong>If he delays shipping beyond a reasonable timeframe,</strong> file a dispute immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Burgduino Electronics</strong> is still active. Do not let him do to you what he did to me.</p>
        <p>I am gathering other victims. If the same thing happened to you, feel free to contact me.</p>
